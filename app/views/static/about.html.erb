<h1>Book of Fate</h1>
<h3>Written by Raphael, 1823</h3>
 
<p>The Book of Fate is a complete course of geomancy, the art of divination drawn by interpreting patterns formed by thrown rocks,  with neat and detailed tables explaining the interpretations of the arrangements of the cast stones. It then proceeds with a series of chapters considering specific questions that might be answered by geomancy: success in law, success in business, success in finding a marriage partner, the sex of offspring, location of lost possessions, outcomes of battles, advice on conduct of war, etc.</p>
 
<p>The book, written by English astrologer Robert Cross Smith, under the pseudonym of Raphael purports to be a copy of a book owned by the Earl of Essex that was confiscated after his execution for high treason. Smith was an important figure in the re-emergence of what is now termed parapsychology in nineteenth-century England and became one of the most-read astrologers of his age. His two early geomantic works also place him within the continuum of literary forgeries associated with figures such as William Henry Ireland. Smith's first publication, also dedicated to geomancy, appeared in 1822, written in conjunction with the astrologer and balloonist, G.W. Graham. It was entitled The Philosophical Merlin, and issued with the authors' initials only: 'G.W.G' and 'R.C.S.' The Philosophical Merlin contained the spurious claim that the work was “the translation of a valuable manuscript, formerly in the possession of Napoleon Bonaparte” suggesting that The Book of Fate, with its equally spurious historical origin, was intended as a continuation or sequel of The Philosophical Merlin.</p>
